# UART TX Communication Protocol with FPGA (TANG NANO 9K) â€“ VHDL

This repository contains a **UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)** transmitter project implemented in **VHDL** on the **TANG NANO 9K** FPGA. The project covers essential components and functionalities such as sending data triggered by a button input, debouncing the button signal, and serial data transmission via the UART protocol.

## Project Purpose

The goals of this project are to:

- Demonstrate how to design a **UART TX** transmitter module on an FPGA,  
- Showcase the use of button debouncing (to clean up noisy signals that occur when a button is pressed),  
- Enable serial data transmission from the FPGA based on a simple counter or user interaction.

Serial communication is frequently used in embedded systems for sending sensor data or control commands. This project illustrates the fundamentals of implementing a UART protocol in FPGA using VHDL.

## Overview

- UART parameters such as **baud rate** can be configured in `UART_TRANSMITTER.vhd` or in the top-level module.  
- A button press triggers the FPGA to send a specific data value or the counter value via the UART interface.  
- **Debounce** logic ensures that noisy button signals are filtered, so a single button press results in the correct data being sent.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `DEBOUNCE_BUTTON.vhd`
- Filters and cleans up the input signal from a physical button.
- Generates a single clean (debounced) pulse corresponding to each button press.
- Utilizes a time-based counter or FSM (Finite State Machine) approach to convert the bouncing signal into a stable output.

### 2. `UART_TRANSMITTER.vhd`
- Transmits data bits serially to the outside world, following the UART protocol.
- Generates the frame consisting of **Start** bit, data bits, and **Stop** bit.
- Uses an internal baud rate generator or an external clock signal (possibly provided by the top-level module) to regulate the data rate.

### 3. `TOP_UART_TX_COUNTER.vhd`
- Serves as the top-level module of the project.
- Instantiates both `DEBOUNCE_BUTTON` and `UART_TRANSMITTER` modules.
- May include a counter (or an additional FSM) to determine which data is sent under which condition.
- Handles pin assignments (such as the clock signal and I/O pins) for the Tang Nano 9K FPGA (specific to your design constraints).
